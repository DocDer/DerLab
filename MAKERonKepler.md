# Guide to MAKER on Kepler

### Overview
MAKER was designed for annotating whole-genome assemblies but it may also be useful for annotating shorter sequences. MAKER streamlines the annotation process, handling the execution of numerous annotation processes, like running sequence aligners, gene predictors, and creating standard files for genomic features such GFF3.
