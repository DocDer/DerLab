# Guide to MAKER Genome Annotation Pipeline on Kepler

### Overview
MAKER was designed for annotating whole-genome assemblies but it may also be useful for annotating shorter sequences. MAKER streamlines the annotation process, handling the execution of numerous annotation processes, like running sequence aligners, gene predictors, and creating standard files for genomic features such GFF3.

### Loading MAKER
MAKER is installed both locally (`/home/joshd/software/`) and globally (`/share/apps/genomics/`). The global installation is probably less reliable than the local one. If you don't already have one, you may need to create or copy a local module file for maker. Information about how to set up your module environment is in KeplerModules.md.

To load MAKER, type

`module load local/maker`

A message should print with the MAKER version number and a short description. This information is hardcoded in the maker module file at 

### Setting up your MAKER space
It's best to create a new directory in which to run MAKER from. When ready to start the run, this directory will contain three control files, your PBS/torque/qsub/shell script to submit to the resource manager TORQUE using `qsub`, explained below. While running, MAKER will generate a very large number of files. Warning: moving a MAKER output directory around in your filesystem takes a very long time.

In this document, $RUNDIR is the location of the hypothetical directory from which MAKER will be executed.

##### Control Files
To generate template control files, from within $RUNDIR and after loading the MAKER module, type `maker -CTL`. This will generate three files:

```
maker_opts.ctl
maker_bopts.ctl
maker_exe.ctl
```

These files contain general settings, BLAST settings, and executable paths for programs executed by MAKER. The syntax for the control files is key=value with # preceeded comments. The control files contain descriptive comments.

#-----Genome (these are always required)
genome= #genome sequence (fasta file or fasta embeded in GFF3 file)
organism_type=eukaryotic #eukaryotic or prokaryotic. Default is eukaryotic

#-----Re-annotation Using MAKER Derived GFF3

#-----EST Evidence (for best results provide a file for at least one)
est= #set of ESTs or assembled mRNA-seq in fasta format
altest= #EST/cDNA sequence file in fasta format from an alternate organism
est_gff= #aligned ESTs or mRNA-seq from an external GFF3 file
altest_gff= #aligned ESTs from a closly relate species in GFF3 format

#-----Protein Homology Evidence (for best results provide a file for at least one)
protein=  #protein sequence file in fasta format (i.e. from mutiple oransisms)
protein_gff=  #aligned protein homology evidence from an external GFF3 file

#-----Repeat Masking (leave values blank to skip repeat masking)
model_org=all #select a model organism for RepBase masking in RepeatMasker
rmlib= #provide an organism specific repeat library in fasta format for RepeatMasker
repeat_protein=/home/joshd/software/maker/data/te_proteins.fasta #provide a fasta file of transposable element proteins for RepeatRunner
rm_gff= #pre-identified repeat elements from an external GFF3 file
prok_rm=0 #forces MAKER to repeatmask prokaryotes (no reason to change this), 1 = yes, 0 = no
softmask=1 #use soft-masking rather than hard-masking in BLAST (i.e. seg and dust filtering)

#-----Gene Prediction
snaphmm= #SNAP HMM file
gmhmm= #GeneMark HMM file
augustus_species= #Augustus gene prediction species model
fgenesh_par_file= #FGENESH parameter file
pred_gff= #ab-initio predictions from an external GFF3 file
model_gff= #annotated gene models from an external GFF3 file (annotation pass-through)
est2genome=0 #infer gene predictions directly from ESTs, 1 = yes, 0 = no
protein2genome=0 #infer predictions from protein homology, 1 = yes, 0 = no
trna=0 #find tRNAs with tRNAscan, 1 = yes, 0 = no
snoscan_rrna= #rRNA file to have Snoscan find snoRNAs
unmask=0 #also run ab-initio prediction programs on unmasked sequence, 1 = yes, 0 = no

#-----Other Annotation Feature Types (features MAKER doesn't recognize)
other_gff= #extra features to pass-through to final MAKER generated GFF3 file

#-----External Application Behavior Options
alt_peptide=C #amino acid used to replace non-standard amino acids in BLAST databases
cpus=1 #max number of cpus to use in BLAST and RepeatMasker (not for MPI, leave 1 when using MPI)

#-----MAKER Behavior Options
max_dna_len=100000 #length for dividing up contigs into chunks (increases/decreases memory usage)
min_contig=1 #skip genome contigs below this length (under 10kb are often useless)
